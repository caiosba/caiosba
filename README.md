Hello! I'm a **senior software engineer** with more than 15 years of experience, primarily working with **Ruby On Rails and JavaScript / React.js** lately.

I'm a **[Certified Ruby Programmer](https://www.credential.net/fhs4mrsf)**, I hold **bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science** from the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil, and I'm currently a special student in the PhD program at the same university.

In 2018, I was one of the five software developers selected to join [Data4Change](https://www.data4chan.ge/), a data visualization workshop on human rights in the Middle East that took place in Beirut, Lebanon. I'm currently ranked as the **[Top 1 Ruby developer in Brazil and Top 10 in the world, according to CodersRank](https://profile.codersrank.io/leaderboard/developer?technology=Ruby)**. I also collaborate as a developer on open source projects such as Ruby On Rails, NPM, Drupal, Noosfero, Moodle, Inkscape, and others, and I have presented at conferences including RubyConf Portugal, Rubyfuza (South Africa), WrocLove.rb (Poland), SIBGRAPI (Peru), PROPOR (Portugal), Tech & Check (Duke University in the United States), CredCon (United States), Mexico on Rails (Mexico), Media Party (Argentina), Mediathon (Peru), RubyConf Brazil, WebMedia, W3C Web Conference, International Free Software Forum, International Free Software Workshop, JSDay, Campus Party, among others.
